# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates a **machine learning approach to classify Iris flower species** based on their physical measurements using classic datasets and popular algorithms. 🌿

## 📝 Overview

The goal is to accurately predict the species of Iris flowers using features including:

- 📏 Sepal length  
- 📐 Sepal width  
- 📏 Petal length  
- 📐 Petal width

## ✨ Features

- **Data Exploration** 🔍: Analyzes statistical properties and distribution of flower measurements.
- **Preprocessing** 🧹: Handles dataset preparation required for classification.
- **Modeling** 🤖: Implements multiple classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors to classify Iris species.
- **Evaluation** 📊: Compares model performances to identify the most accurate approach.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python  
- 🐼 pandas for data handling  
- 🔗 scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms  
- 📒 Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and visualization

## 📚 Dataset

Uses the well-known `IRIS.csv` dataset consisting of 150 samples with measurements and species labels for three Iris flower types.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. 🧬 Clone the repository.  
2. 📦 Install necessary packages: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `jupyter`.  
3. 💻 Run the Jupyter notebook `IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb` to explore the data, train classifiers, and evaluate their accuracy.
